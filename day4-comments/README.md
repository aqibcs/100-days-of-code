# Day-4: Comments, Escape sequences and Print statement

## Comments:
- Comments are used to explain or describe code, helping others understand it better.
- In Python, comments start with a `#` symbol and extend to the end of the line.
### For Example:
```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello World!") # This is also a comment
```

## Escape sequences:
- Escape sequences are special characters used to represent non-printable or difficult-to-type characters within strings.
- Common escape sequences in Python include `\n` for a newline, `\t` for a tab, `\\` for a backslash, and `\"` for a double quote.
### For Instance:
```python
print("Hello \nWorld!") # This prints "Hello" and "World!" on seperate lines
print("C:\\path\\to\\file") # This prints a file path with backslashes
```

### Print Statement:
- The `print` statement/function in Python is used to output text or variables to the console.
-  It can take multiple arguments seperated by commas and automatically adds a space between them.
### For example:
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("Name:" name, "Age:" age) # This prints "Name: Alice Age: 30"
```

Putting it all together, you can use comments to explain your code, escape sequences to handle special characters in strings, and the `print` statement to display output to the user or developer.
