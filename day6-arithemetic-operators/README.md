# Operators
Python has different types of operators for different operations. To create a calculator we require arithmetic operators.

## Arithmetic operators

|Operator |Operator Name  |Example               |
|--|----------------------|----------------------|
|+ |`Addition`            |``` 15+7 ```          |
|- |`Subtraction`         |``` 15-7 ```          |
|* |`Multiplication`      |``` 5*7 ```           |
|**|`Exponential`         |``` 5**3 ```          |
|/ |`Division`            |``` 5/3 ```           |
|% |`Modulus`             |``` 15%7 ```          |
|//|`Floor Division`      |``` 15//7 ```         |

## Exercise
```python
n = 15
m = 7

# Addition
addition_result = n + m
print("The sum of", n, "and", m, "is", addition_result)

# Subtraction
subtraction_result = n - m
print("The difference between", n, "and", m, "is", subtraction_result)

# Multiplication
multiplication_result = n * m
print("The product of", n, "and", m, "is", multiplication_result)

# Division
division_result = n / m
print("The quotient of", n, "and", m, "is", division_result)

# Modulus
modulus_result = n % m
print("The remainder when", n, "is divided by", m, "is", modulus_result)

# Floor Division
floor_division_result = n // m
print("The integer division of", n, "and", m, "is", floor_division_result)

```
# Explanation
Here `n` and `m` are two variables in which the integer value is being stored. Variables `addition_result` , `subtraction_result` ,`multiplication_result`, `division_result`,`modulus_result` and `floor_division_result` contains the outputs corresponding to addition, subtraction,multiplication, division, modulus and floor division respectively.
