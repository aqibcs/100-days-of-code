## What is programming?
Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dump machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at-computation.

## What is Python?
- Python is dynamically typed, general purpose programming language the supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a function programming approach.
- Python is an interpreted and high-level programming language.
- It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.

## Features of Python
- Python is simple and easy to understand.
- It is interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
- Python is an open-source programming language.
- Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include Numpy, OpenCV, panda, etc.
- It is possible to integrate other programming within python.

## What is Python uses for?
- Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
- Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
- It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
- It is used to create web application.
- It can be used to handle databases.
- It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qanlitative analysis.
